### Code Repo for [jacobheil.com](http://jacobheil.com/)

I used the [Highlights template from HTML5up](https://html5up.net/highlights). Photography credit for he big ol' picture of my head goes to Chelsea Carlson (woo '16). Photo credit for image of me and Sweet Pea and Buddy goes to my awesomely talented sister, [Kristen Kidd Photography](https://www.facebook.com/kristenkiddphotography/). The third photo was taken by me in Denver, near Devil's Head, and the fourth is just from a roadside "scenic view" on I64 (East) in Virginia between Staunton and Charlottesville.
